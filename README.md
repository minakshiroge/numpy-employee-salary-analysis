NumPy Project: Employee Salary Analysis
Employee salary analysis using Python and NumPy

## Objective
Analyze employee salary data and find useful insights using NumPy.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy

## Salary Data (in thousands)
Employee salaries are stored in a NumPy array for analysis.

## Analysis Performed
- Calculated total number of employees
- Found minimum, maximum, average, and median salary
- Analyzed salary distribution using standard deviation and variance
- Filtered employees earning more than 100,000
- Projected salary growth for the next 5 years

## Key Insights
- Salaries range from 50,000 to 200,000
- Average salary is around 105,000
- Median salary gives a better picture than average
- Salary distribution shows high variation
- Salaries grow by 5% every year

## Business Impact
- Helps HR and finance teams understand salary structure
- Identifies salary gaps and high-paid employees
- Supports better compensation and financial planning

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NumPy can be used for real-world salary and HR data analysis.
